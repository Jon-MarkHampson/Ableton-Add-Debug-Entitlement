# Ableton-Add-Debug-Entitlement

This script allows you to modify entitlements for hardened macOS applications to enable debugging without turning off System Integrity Protection (SIP). Itâ€™s particularly useful for plugin developers working on macOS.

## Credits

This script is based on an original script by [talaviram](https://gist.github.com/talaviram/1f21e141a137744c89e81b58f73e23c3). Some modifications made by Jon-Mark Hampson.

## Modifications
- Removal of extended attributes to prevent codesign errors on macOS Sonoma.
- Added functionality to create an entitlements plist if one does not already exist.

## How to Use

### Step 1: Download or Clone the Script

You can either download the script directly or clone the repository.

#### Option 1: Download

1. Click the "Code" button at the top of the repository page.
2. Select "Download ZIP".
3. Extract the ZIP file to a location of your choice (e.g., your Desktop).

#### Option 2: Clone

Alternatively, if you have Git installed, you can clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Jon-MarkHampson/Ableton-Add-Debug-Entitlement-Script.git

===========================================================

### Step 2: Make the Script Executable
Open Terminal:

Go to Applications > Utilities > Terminal.
Navigate to the Script Directory:

If you downloaded the script to your Desktop, run:
cd ~/Desktop

If you cloned the repository, navigate to the cloned directory:
cd /path/to/your/cloned/repository
Make the Script Executable:

Run the following command to make the script executable:
chmod +x ableton_add_debug_entitlement.sh

===========================================================


### Step 3: Run the Script
Run the Script with Administrative Privileges:

You need to provide the path to the application you want to re-codesign. For example, to re-codesign Ableton Live 12, run:

sudo ./ableton_add_debug_entitlement.sh "/Applications/Ableton Live 12 Suite.app" // you can replace with your version of Live when required

The sudo command is required because modifying system files and re-signing applications requires administrative privileges.

Script Execution:

The script will:
Remove extended attributes from the application.
Extract the current entitlements and modify them to allow debugging.
Re-sign the application with the modified entitlements.
Successful Execution:

===========================================================

If everything works correctly, you should see a message indicating that re-signing and entitlements were applied successfully.

===========================================================

Troubleshooting:

Operation Not Permitted: If you see this error, make sure the Terminal (or whatever application you're using to run the script) has Full Disk Access enabled. You can do this in System Preferences > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access.

Application Marked as Damaged: If the application doesn't open after re-signing, you may need to re-download the application and try the process again, ensuring all steps are followed correctly.
